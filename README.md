# PythonToPseudocode
I got bored of converting Python to Pseudocode, so I made this.
<h3>Some notes to be made</h3>
<ol>
  <li>docker.txt and out.txt are tests</li>
  <li>This whole project is still in development, so don't use it yet!!</li>
  <li>Unfortunately, doesn't yet add NEXT or ENDIF</li>
</ol>
<h3>How to use</h3>
<ol>
   <li>Put your python code in docker.txt(Remember this only works for increments, print statements, for loops, while loops and initialising variables at the moment.)</li>
  <li>Find your generated pseudocode in out.txt. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<ol>
   <li>In your while loop and if statements, remember to not put brackets(ie: while a>5:). If you put brackets the program will not work.</li>
   <li>Also, your python code has to run perfectly otherwise.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Enjoy!</h2>

# PythonToPseudocode
I got bored of converting Python to Pseudocode, so I made this.
<h3>Some notes to be made</h3>
<ol>
  <li>docker.txt and out.txt are tests</li>
  <li>This whole project is still in development, so don't use it yet!!</li>
  <li>Unfortunately, doesn't yet add NEXT or ENDIF</li>
</ol>
<h3>How to use</h3>
<ol>
   <li>Put your python code in docker.txt(Remember this only works for increments, print statements, for loops, while loops and initialising variables at the moment.)</li>
  <li>Find your generated pseudocode in out.txt. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<ol>
   <li>In your while loop and if statements, remember to not put brackets(ie: while a>5:). If you put brackets the program will not work.</li>
   <li>Also, your python code has to run perfectly otherwise.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Want to contribute but don't understand pseudocode?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No need to worry! Simply read this PDF on pseudocode(only looping, conditionals and the basic stuff including above) at the moment: https://pdfhost.io/v/2DAZTyjip_Pseudocode_Syntaxpdf.pdf. It should be easy to understand. You can then open a PR. I would love it if you could contribute to this project!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Enjoy!</h2>

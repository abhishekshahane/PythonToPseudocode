# PythonToPseudocode
I got bored of converting Python to Pseudocode, so I made this.
<h3>Some notes to be made</h3>
<ol>
  <li>docker.txt and out.txt are tests</li>
  <li>This whole project is still in development, so don't use it yet!!</li>
  <li>Unfortunately, doesn't yet add NEXT or ENDIF</li>
</ol>
# How to use

1. Put your python code in docker.txt(Remember this only works for increments, print statements, for loops, while loops and initialising variables at the moment.)

2. Next, luckily for you, we've made a CLI to make this process easier. Simply run `--help` to see a help message or to run, type `cli.py --run [FILE]`, where [FILE] is your file(incase you wanted to migrate from make.py). Also, in case you were wondering, I used argparse to build that. Anyways, signing off on the project for now. Abhishek - 20/10/2020.

<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<ol>
   <li>Your python code has to run perfectly otherwise.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Want to contribute but don't understand pseudocode?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No need to worry! Simply read this PDF on pseudocode(only looping, conditionals and the basic stuff mentioned above) at the moment: https://pdfhost.io/v/2DAZTyjip_Pseudocode_Syntaxpdf.pdf. It should be easy to understand. You can then open a PR. I would love it if you could contribute to this project!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Enjoy!</h2>
